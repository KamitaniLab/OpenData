# Generic Object Decoding: Questions and answers

## How can I get stimulus images?

We do not include stimulus image files in the open dataset because of license issues.
Instead, we provide a downloading script at [GitHub](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/GenericObjectDecoding).
Alternatively, you can contact us via [email](mailto:brainliner-admin@atr.jp) for sharing the image files.
